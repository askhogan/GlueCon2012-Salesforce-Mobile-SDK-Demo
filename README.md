# GlueCon 2012 Salesforce Mobile SDK Demo

Install the [Salesforce Mobile SDK](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Mobile_SDK) and create a new "Hybrid Force.com App" project according to instructions in the  [README](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS/blob/master/readme.md). Clone this project and drop the files into your hybrid app's folder, overwriting `forcetk.js`, `index.html` and `inline.js`, and creating a new `images` folder.
